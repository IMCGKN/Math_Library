MATH LIBRARY WRITTEN ENTIRELY IN C++ WITH NO LIBRARIES / TOOLS

This math library consists of:

Vec2, Vec3, and Matrix4x4

Area of circle functions

Trigonometry functions


functions:

floor and ceil

pow2 and pow

max and abs




DOCUMENTATION:

_PI_ = pi value

_HALF_PI_ = half pi, used in _cos_ function.


_pow2_ is a funtion that returns takes one argument of any numeric data type and returns it powered.

_pow_ is the same but it takes 2 arguments. One is the number that you want to raise it to power of second argument.


_max_ is a function that returns highest number of two numbers.

_abs_ returns an absolute version of argument.


_sqrt_ is a function that returns a double that is used to denote square root or nth roots.

_toRadians_ takes one argument in degrees and converts it to radians.

_toRadians_ takes one argument in radians and converts it to degrees.


_factorial_ In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer a, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a.


_sin_ _cos_ _tan_ are all trigonometric functions that take one argument.

_floor_ takes one float argument and returns smallest possible number of this float argument.

_ceil_ takes one float argument and returns biggest possible number of this float argument.

_areaOfCircle_ takes radius and returns area this circle;

_radiusOfCircle_ takes circumference and returns radius this circle;


NOTE: All this classes below uses overload operators.

VEC3:

is a class that contains many functions and 3 floats: _x_, _y_, _z_

You can use this class to add, devide, multiply and subtract two vectors.

You can also assign values of one vector to the other.

VEC2:

is a class that contains many functions and 2 floats: _x_, _y_

You can use this class to add, devide, multiply and subtract two vectors.

You can also assign values of one vector to the other.

MATRIX4v4:

is a class used to demonstrate 4x4 MATRIX.

Math is a rectangular array or table of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns.

It is used mostly in graphics programming in 3d or 2d.

is a class that contains many functions and 1 array of float: _mat_
You can use this class to add, devide, multiply and subtract two matrices.
